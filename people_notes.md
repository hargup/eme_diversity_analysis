Region Methodology:

* Look up their personal website and social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn,
  Github) and see if it mentions the country they live in. (Works in Most of the cases)
* If the person's email has uses a country specific top level domain, assume that as the country
* If github profile is available look up the timezone on last 5 commits.
* For people who have moved from their home country I'm considering the country where they live now.

Work Methodology

* Look up their personal website and social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn,
  Github) and see if it mentions the country. (Works in Most of the cases)
* Assign the others category
* Google's position is very interesting, it is DRM provider as a browser
manufacturer but also a content provider in Youtube and fair number of Google
Employers are against EME due to other concerns. I'm placing Christian as Content provider because he works on Youtube, and I've placed everyone else as DRM provider.
* People who work on Accessibility, Privacy or Security but also fit into first three categories are categorized in one of the first three categories. For example someone who works on privacy in Google will be placed in "DRM platform provider" instead of "Privacy".
